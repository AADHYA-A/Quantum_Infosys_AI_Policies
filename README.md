### ðŸ”® Quantum Integration

This project also explores the integration of **Quantum Computing** concepts to enhance text analysis and policy retrieval. The quantum components focus on improving semantic understanding and similarity detection beyond classical NLP methods.

#### ðŸ§  Quantum Models Used

* **Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP):** Enables deeper contextual understanding of policy texts.
* **Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM):** Improves classification accuracy for policy categorization.
* **Quantum k-Means:** Clusters similar policy documents using quantum optimization techniques.
* **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs):** Enhance semantic representation and relationship mapping.
* **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models:** Combine the strengths of quantum computing with classical NLP for efficient and precise information retrieval.

These integrations demonstrate how **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** can complement traditional AI methods to achieve **better accuracy, scalability, and contextual understanding** in policy analysis systems.
